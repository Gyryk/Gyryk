### Pretty much almost every repository you find is going to be a work in progress... lol
#### My primary focus lately has been programming in python and creating websites using native JavaScript and HTML-CSS, though I also work with frameworks like Vue/React 
#### I work on projects of all sorts in various languages, and I'm always open to new opportunities for collaborations
#### I don't really have many public projects at the moment, but I'll fix that soon enough :)
