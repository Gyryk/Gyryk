### Pretty much almost every repository you find is going to be a work in progress... lol <br>
My primary focus lately has been programming in python and creating websites using native JavaScript and HTML-CSS, though I also work with frameworks like Vue/React <br> <br>
I work on projects of all sorts in various languages, and I'm always open to new opportunities for collaboration <br>
I know that I don't have a lot of public projects up right now, but I swear that isn't going to last very long
